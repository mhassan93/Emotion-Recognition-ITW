# Emotion Recognition
<h3>Valence and Arousal estimation on Aff-Wild database</h3>

The model used for this was ResNet with CBAM attention module for refined feature learning. The data is available at <a href="https://github.com/dkollias/Aff-Wild-models">at the Aff-Wild github repository.</a>
Valence and arousal were learned using features from videos in Aff-Wild. These values were then used to assign emotion based on the 2D Valence-Arousal Space
